# Influence Computation and Maximization

This project constitutes the original C++ implementation of the influence oracle and influence maximization algorithms, which were developed in the paper _[Sketch-based Influence Maximization and Computation: Scaling Up with Guarantees](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2662077)_ by [Edith Cohen](http://www.cohenwang.com/edith/), [Daniel Delling](http://danieldelling.com/), [Thomas Pajor](http://tpajor.com/), and [Renato Werneck](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rwerneck/). The paper was presented at [CIKM 2014](http://cikm2014.fudan.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, China.

The code was developed at [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com) and has been released under MIT license.
