# Influence Maximization in Public Private Social Networks

This project is for experimental analysis of a research problem: When users in a social network has privacy settings (e.g: my friends are private) only the user can see the connections but not everyone in the network. In a model where the graph is different for each user, how do we solve influence maximization problem.

This project constitutes the original C++ implementation of the influence oracle and influence maximization algorithms, which were developed in the paper _[Sketch-based Influence Maximization and Computation: Scaling Up with Guarantees](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2662077)_ by [Edith Cohen](http://www.cohenwang.com/edith/), [Daniel Delling](http://danieldelling.com/), [Thomas Pajor](http://tpajor.com/), and [Renato Werneck](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rwerneck/). The paper was presented at [CIKM 2014](http://cikm2014.fudan.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, China.

The code was developed at [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com) and has been released under MIT license.
